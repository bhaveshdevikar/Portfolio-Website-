                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that's used for a variety of purposes, including web development, web apps, game development, and more.
                    JavaScript also lets you add dynamic features to web sites that you can't just achieve with HTML and CSS.</p>
                <h3>Importance of javascript</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is the most important language you need to learn as a frontend developer. It's a great first language for web developers to learn because: <br>

                    1.Web apps are dynamic because of JavaScript. <br>
                    2.When it comes to responsive design, JavaScript comes in handy. <br>
                    3.For backend and server-side programming, JavaScript is one of the most effective languages. <br>
                  
                    JavaScript makes up a crucial part of the structure of any website, along with HTML and CSS: <br> 
                    HTML forms the basic structure of the website.
                    CSS is used for styling the websites.
                    JavaScript makes the website dynamic and allows you to add some animation.
                    When you're starting to learn about web development basics, the vast amount of resources out there might overwhelm you. So in this guide, I'm sharing some of my favorite resources to learn JavaScript to help you get started.</p> <br>
